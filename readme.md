This is a very simple demonstration of how to get your users to log-in to your website and manage their Google Calendar.
In order to do this, we need to get a refresh token for every user, by asking their permission to log-in.

You are first required to create a Google API Application and to give it Google Calendar permissions and an allowed redirect url to the "google-login.php" page that you have to upload on your domain.

By using this link, you will get the refresh token displayed:

https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcalendar&redirect_uri=https://www.[yourdomain].it/google-login.php&response_type=code&client_id=[APP_CLIENT_ID]&access_type=offline&prompt=consent

Then you can use the following functions at any given time, the access token (that lasts only 1 hour), will always be regenerated by the refresh token:

https://www.[yourdomain].it/add_event.php?title=YourTitle
https://www.[yourdomain].it/upcoming.php
